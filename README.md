# LiveControl

This is a simple Minecraft plugin that leverages Minecraft's default whitelist system to run a timer for when people are and are not allowed to join the server. When the timer expires, a short grace period that stops player joining before kicking the remaining players.

It is all easily configurable by code, so feel free. It could use a little bit of polishing and eye-candy, but works well in my experience.
